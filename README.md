# üìä Tracking
 ## Tracking at Moneymate website:
 
I have used **Google Analytics** for tracking. I am **tracking frontend** for **page views** and **form submission**. I am using **react-ga4** to add GA to my website. 
### Why: 

Since I have built a React **Single Page App** (SPA) using React Router, react-ga4 is a better choice. Because react-ga4 helps track page views on route changes.
Let‚Äôs say if a user goes from /login to /home: without react-ga4 no page view is tracked, but with react-ga4, I can send a pageview manually when the route changes.

### Privacy:

Tracking is implemented in compliance with **GDPR** and other privacy regulations. No personally identifiable information (PII) is collected.


# üîê Security
  ## Security (threats and vulnerabilities) at MoneyMate Website:
  
 - Added a **login system**, which is a step towards securing the website
      - It is preventing unauthorized access
      - Only authenticated users can add/delete/edit data
      - User can view only their own transactions
        
 - Validated and sanitized inputs in the backend using **Joi** Library
      - It prevents bad data from being saved

 - Used **bcrypt to hash passwords**
      - Password are secured before storing in database

### Threat at website which I have not mitigated:

  **To securely store sensitive data**: First I used local storage and then js-cookie to store my userId. I am rendering user names in my frontend, Which is vulnerable to XSS attacks. Instead, there are two methods to do it securely:
   - By using HTTP-only cookies
   - By using JWT
