# üìä Tracking
 ## Tracking at Moneymate website:
 
I have used **Google Analytics** for tracking. I am **tracking frontend** for **page views** and **form submission**. I am using **react-ga4** to add GA to my website. 
### Why: 

Since I have built a React **Single Page App** (SPA) using React Router, react-ga4 is a better choice. Because react-ga4 helps track page views on route changes.
Let‚Äôs say if a user goes from /login to /home: without react-ga4 no page view is tracked, but with react-ga4, I can send a pageview manually when the route changes.

### Privacy:

Tracking is implemented in compliance with **GDPR** and other privacy regulations. No personally identifiable information (PII) is collected.


# üîê Security
  ## Security (threats and vulnerabilities) at MoneyMate Website:
  
 - Added a **login system**, which is a step towards securing the website
      - It is preventing unauthorized access
      - Only authenticated users can add/delete/edit data
      - User can view only their own transactions
      - Used **bcrypt to hash passwords**
          - Password are secured before storing in database
        
 - Validated and sanitized inputs in the backend using **Joi** Library
      - It prevents bad data from being saved
      - Used during login, signup, creating and updating transactions


### Threat at website which I have not mitigated:

  **To securely store sensitive data**: Currently at MoneyMate I am storing the username and userId in cookies using **js-cookie** after login, which creates a potential **security risk**. Storing user identifiers in plain cookies without encryption introduces several vulnerabilities.
  
  **To resolve this issue and strengthen security in future updates**: 
  - HTTP-only cookies will be implemented:
     - It is morden and more secure way of authentication
     - It helps to protect from XSS attacks, since client-side javascript can not access HTTP-only cookies
